I will not rest until I discover the truth
I will not rest until I discover the truth
(Can't rest)
I will not rest until I discover the truth
I will not rest until I discover the truth
(Can't rest)
I will not rest until I discover the truth
(I will not, I will not)
I will not rest until I discover the truth
(Can't rest until I discover the truth)

None were fools
Children and fools
Speak the truth

Cause I hear the cracking of your heart
And so shall it tear to the worst that you fear
But don't turn around if you think that I'm here
And so shall it tear to the worst that you fear
But don't turn around if you think that I'm here
I'm not fool
Cause I'm not fool
