Baby we should take some time
I might change my ways
Might change your mind

If you give me one more try
I swear I'll try, I'll try

'Cause there ain't no time to waste
I gotta leave right now
I gotta change my name
Need to hide my face
And whip a Benz, no plates
Keep my foot on the gas
Hope I ain't catchin' a case
Yeah, I know you won't last
I can see in your face
We the ones that they love
And you the one that they hate
'Cause you another motherfucker
That's close to goin' under
And I'm another motherfucker
The type to fuck your mother

You might get caught up in the moment
But Drip got a clip that's fully loaded
You don't want a problem, you know it
But your girl, I can tell you where she goin'
She's goin' home with me

Pull up, fast car, baby I wanna race it
I just can't believe all the time that I wasted
Touchin' on your body, baby you lookin' sacred
I'ma go to hell, I'm so close I can taste it
Kiss me on my neck before I fall asleep
I kinda wanna die but not actually
You the only one that never doubted me
We fuckin' in a jet flyin' overseas
I'm a fuckin' ghost to all my ex hoes
Broke my heart and then it turned cold
Heart so cold, my chest feel like snow
Only one life so please don't let go

I'm the only one and you know it

One and you know...
We was fuckin' I was still gettin' loaded

I was still gettin' loaded
Ain't no friends because of all of em folded

Because of all of em folded

Blicky on my hip I'ma tote it, bitch I'ma tote it

'Cause there ain't no time to waste
I gotta leave right now
I gotta change my name
Need to hide my face
And whip a Benz, no plates
Keep my foot on the gas
Hope I ain't catchin' a case
Yeah, I know you won't last
I can see in your face
We the ones that they love
And you the one that they hate
'Cause you another motherfucker
That's close to goin' under
And I'm another motherfucker
The type to fuck your mother

You might get caught up in the moment
But Drip got a clip that's fully loaded
You don't want a problem, you know it
But your girl, I can tell you where she goin'
She's goin' home with me
