I could have been more honest baby
I could have been more straight
I could have been more everything
Now it's all too late
But don't you try to overanalyze
Every silence, every word
I see you're gonna try and hurt me now
Is that my just reward?
Leave it all to me
I'm on the nerve this to live
Is there any tea left?
Any tea left
Leave it all to me
I'm on the nerve this to live
Is there any tea left?
Any tea left
We are playing the blame game
We are playing the blame game
We are playing the blame game
I could have been more honest
I could have been more straight
I could have been more of everything
We are playing the blame game
Now it's all too late
We are playing the blame game
But don't you try to overanalyze
Every silence, every word
We are playing the blame game
I see you're gonna try and hurt me now
Is that my just reward?
Leave it all to me
I'm on the nerve this to live
Is there any tea left?
Any tea left
