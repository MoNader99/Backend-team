I remember that time we were sippin' on wine
I could see it in your eyes, you were feeling alive
Why tell you I was good, why the fuck would I lie? (Why?)
I remember saying twice, "Baby, I shouldn't drive"
"I should let you hold the keys, baby, take 'em inside"
If you'd taken my advice, maybe then you'd survived, yeah
I've been looking at the sky all night and ain't see shit
Thinking how you died, but you said I could be shit
Now I'm on my grind, baby, look at me now
Look at me now, yeah
All this cash on me make 'em wanna go down
I could fill your cup girl, I could make you slow down
I could show you up baby, I'ma pour a fo'
Sippin' all day baby what you waiting fo'?
If you need a drink, I got drugs on me
Gotta watch for the 12, I got drugs on me
I've been going hard, I've been working OT
I'ma make a stack, put in on my mommy (yeah)
Right when I swing at the ground then you blink
I got the drop like you spilling your drink
Fuck what they saying and fuck what they think
I know they gon' love me when Gucci my links
Lines on the sink, pills in the drink
I'm coming and taking the ring
I remember that time we were sippin' on wine
I could see it in your eyes, you were feeling alive
Why tell you I was good, why the fuck would I lie? (Why?)
