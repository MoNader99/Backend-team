First things first, I'mma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been
Oh Oooh
The way that things have been
Oh Oooh
Second things second, Don't you tell me what you thing that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea
Oh Oooh
The master of my sea
Oh Oooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my soul into the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, Took at me, Shook at me, Feel at me
Singing from heart ache to the pain
Taking my message from the pain
Speaking my lessons from the brain
Seeing the beauty through love
Pain
You made me a, You made me a believer
Believer
Pain
You break me down, You build me up believer
Believer
Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you heard has turned your spirit to a dove
Oh Oooh
Your spirit up above
Oh Oooh
I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the clouds
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings they would drown
But they never did, ever leave, ebbid and flowing, hibbited limited till they broke up
And it rain down, rain down
Pain
You made me a, You made me a believer
Believer
Pain
You break me down, You build me up believer
Believer
Pain
You let the bullets fly and let them
Rain
My life, My love, My prophet came from
Pain
You made me a, You made me a believer
Believer
Pain
Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins
Oh Oooh
The blood in my veins
Oh Oooh
But they never did, ever leave, ebbid and flowing, hibbited limited till they broke up
And it rain down
And it rain down
Pain
You made me a, You made me a believer
Believer
Pain
You break me down, You build me up believer
Believer
Pain
You let the bullets fly and let them
Rain
My life, My love, My prophet came from
Pain
You made me a, You made me a believer
Believer
