You've made your bed, now lie in it
I pull a leash on my dog
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let dogs lie
Let sleeping dogs lie
You're my servant boy
Handsome slave
Boy let the dogs sleep in that cave
Servant boy
Handsome slave
Be my shoe shine
Shoe shine, BOY
Boy made my shoe shine
Be my shoe shine
Shoe shine boy
Made my shoe shine
You're my servant boy
Handsome slave
Boy let the dogs sleep in that cave
Servant boy
Handsome slave
Boy let the dogs sleep in that cave
Made my shoe shine
Shoe shine boy
Made my shoes shine
Shoe shine boy
Made my shoe shine
Shoe shine boy
Made my shoe shine
